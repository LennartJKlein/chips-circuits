# Experiments

This repository is used to run experiments to these de endurance of the algorithms with divergent netlist and gate configurations. The complete functionality of sample has been copied into experiments. This makes it possible to easily download the content and rerun the experiments. Again see the [documentation](https://lennartjklein.github.io/pathfinder/) for details about the program.

## Notable content:

### netlist-length

The first directory looks at the effect of diverent lenghts of netlists. These are also generated by a random number generator is netlist-length/generators.

### gates-position (to be executed)

The second directory's experiment is setup to see if the effect of changing positions of gates. Gate lists are randomized by a random number generators. The generator is in netlist-length/generators. This experiment is still to be executed.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need the following:

* [0Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.6.3
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) 1.13.3
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/index.html) 2.1.0

## Installation

Clone or download this repository (containing the pathfinder module) to a folder of your preference. And make sure the requirements above are installed.
